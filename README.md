# odin-recipes

The project's goal is to build a basic recipe website using the basics knowledge learned in the first few chapters about HTML in the Odin's project:
	-write the structure of an html file
	-add paragraphs and heads
	-add absolute and relative links
	-add images
and save it with git and upload it into GitHub.
