        <h3>A delicious layered chocolate cake</h3>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Simply  the best chocolate cake recipes I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  It's moist and fudgy but still has a light cake crumb.  It’s got a depth of flavor (which I would attribute to the coffee) and a distinct rich deep chocolate essence.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1¾ cups (210g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups (400g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup (90g) good quality unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ cup (112g) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 extra-large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons McCormick pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup (237g) freshly brewed hot coffee (I use decaf)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F and spray two 8-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry. With the mixer still on low, add the coffee and stir just to combine, scraping the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into two 8-inch round prepared pans and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick comes out mostly clean (not wet).</li>
        <li>Cool in the pans for 30 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack and cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
