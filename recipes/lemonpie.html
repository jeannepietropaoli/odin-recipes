        <h3>A traditionnal meringuee lemon pie just out of the oven (I could not resist)</h3>
    
        <p>
            Unbelievably creamy lemon pie is just like key lime pie with a lemon twist and toasty almond graham cracker crust. Made with 7 simple ingredients, you'll appreciate the ease and simplicity of this refreshing dessert.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Graham Cracker Almond Crust</li>
            <ul>
                <li>9 (135g) full-sheet graham crackers</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (62g) salted almonds (I used roasted)</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
                <li>5 Tablespoons (72g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Filling + Topping</li>
            <ul>
                <li>2 (14 ounce weight) cans full-fat sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (180ml) fresh lemon juice (about 4 lemons)</li>
                <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>garnish: lemon zest, lemon slices, almonds etc</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
            <li>Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers and almonds together into crumbs. A few larger pieces of nuts is OK! Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. Press tightly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Pre-bake crust for 8 minutes. Leave oven on.</li>
            <li>Make the filling: Whisk the sweetened condensed milk, lemon juice, and egg yolks together- or use an electric mixer. Pour into warm crust.</li>
            <li>Bake the pie for 18-21 minutes or until only *slightly* jiggly in the center. You want it mostly set. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely on a wire rack. Once cool, cover and chill for at least 1 hour (and up to 3 days) before serving.</li>
            <li>Garnish as desired. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
